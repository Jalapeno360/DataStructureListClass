"# DataStructureListClass"  

Homework 1

Stacks, queues and the list using linked list


Write a list class to implement a doubly linked list. The list should accommodate integers and pointers. You may add other types as you need them. Include member functions for the following:

void insert_front(int data );
void insert_front(void *data );
void insert_rear(int data );
void insert_rear(void *data );
int   remove_front_i( );
void *  remove_front_p( );
int   remove_rear_i( );
void * remove_rear_p( );
int   empty( );  

Use dynamic memory. Use the "new" instruction to allocate memory when inserting and the delete instruction to return the memory when removing. Make the list into a class where the actual list is private and the member functions are public. Prove your program correctness by applying several test cases. Itâ€™s up to you to decide what test cases will provide sufficient confidence your program works correctly. The output should have several test cases. Do a good job as you will use this class in the remainder of your programming assignments.
